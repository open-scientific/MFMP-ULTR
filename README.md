# MFMP-ULTR
Research into ULTR project concept by MFMP

## Background
The use of low cost ultrasonic jewellery cleaners operating in the 40khz range in combination with metal foils was found to damage the foil and tear apart. upon inspection evidence of LENR or condensed nuclear matter physics were observed, upon high speed camera capture under microscope focus magneto toroidal activities can be witnessed.

### Observations

- Foil tears apart in .5mm or smaller chunks (?Circular).
- Detritus spins in vortex paterns.
- Detritus breaks down into smaller particles over longer period of time.
- Foil deposit markings that wont rub off (leave foil in solution for X time once finer particles appear).
- Detritus groups into two distinct sets of particles (Micro foil pieces, Unknown nano particles).
- Foaming begins, larger bubbles pop like hydrogen when flame introduced.
- Particles settled into filaments on Bronze Wool wire when left to settle.
- Gel like substance begins to form when left to settle (easily disperses).


### Follow up todo

- [ ] Test Wires (do they break down)
- [ ] Test Plates (Is the surface changed)
- [ ] Test other materials (Ni, Cu, Fe, C)
- [ ] Test detritus with magnet.
- [ ] Collect detritus, examine qualities for use in dusty plasmas.
- [ ] Microscopy of detritus.
